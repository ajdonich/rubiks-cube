    "This Notebook demonstrates my first successful Rubik's cube solution using an implementation of the (cube-)layer based solution strategy: CFOP. Albeit, the last layer employs an easily searchable set of about 80 explicitly defined move sequences that were developed (primarily) by Jessica Fridrich back in the 80's (see [CFOP_OLL_ALGS.TXT](../data/CFOP_OLL_ALGS.TXT) and [CFOP_PLL_ALGS.TXT](../data/CFOP_PLL_ALGS.TXT) for the explict Singmaster move sequences employed during the OLL and PLL stages).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two stages, Cross and F2L, are solved using a stepped series of UCB tree searches. A typical (successful) search will likely generate between 5-15 million nodes in total and visit about a 40-45% of those. It usually takes 5-10 minutes to converge to a solution, though it can take over 20 at times and some cubes fail to converge at all (using my default configuation parameters anyway).\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, the lion's share of the solution logic here is contained in the [CfopSolver](../rubiks/solver/CfopSolver.py) and [CfopState](../rubiks/solver/CfopState.py) classes.\n",
