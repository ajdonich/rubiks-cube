    "\n",
    "This notebook highlights my progress thus far explorating a solution strategy based qualitatively more on cube movement than on individual cube states. Taking advantage of the its periodic nature, I developed a [CyclicSolver](../rubiks/solver/CyclicSolver.py) class designed to formalize the Rubik's cube's foundational periodic movement cycles. The periodic cycles of any **single side** are summarized in the table below. From these, we can build up a set of **two-sided** periodic move cycles, as further illustrated in the following cells:\n",

    "\n",
    "The following cells demonstrate the surprising result of a relatively unsophisticated search for maximally ordered cube permutations across the 2-sided cyclic move sequences. Though the solutions are far from optimal with respect to number of moves (i.e. far greater than God's number of 20 moves to a solution), they often complete the F2L step and at times even the OLL and definitely perk my interest for further exploration here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given cube scramble below, several searches are conducted using various move-depths (meaning the number of moves down each cycle a search is allowed to proceed). Any set of integer search depths may be chosen, as well as the special values: 'length' (indicating only the base length of each cycle is used, i.e. [4, 5, 6, 7, or 8]), or 'period' (indicated the full period of each cycle is used, i.e. [12, 15, 24, 30, 60, 75, 90, 105, 126, 180, 210, 270, or 315]). Of course, greater depths require greater execution times; with the default search depths below, my machine requires 45-50 minutes to complete the following cells (10-15 then 30-35).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the less precise 'order' heuristic seems to produce comparable or better results than the 'dance' heuristic. And though not always the case, a depth of 30 or 60 seems a kind of sweet spot, often coming closest to a full solution (defined by an order heuristic value of 72, or a dance heuristic value of 216, which incidentally, is measuring a few additional quantities beyond just the \"face-to-face\" orientation). For a detailed understanding of the heuristic, please see the dance_heuristics function in [DirectSolver](../rubiks/solver/DirectSolver.py).\n",
